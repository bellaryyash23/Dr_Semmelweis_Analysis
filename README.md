# ðŸ©ºDr.Semmelweis Handwashing Analysis using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly & Seaborn of Python

ðŸŒŸIn the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs, or viruses. People illness was caused by "bad air" or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever.

ðŸŒŸIn June 1846, Dr Semmelweis ordered everyone on his medical staff to start cleaning their hands and instruments not just with soap and water but with a chlorine solution (he didn't know it at the time, but chlorine is an amazing disinfectant). The reason Dr Semmelweis actually chose the chlorine was that he wanted to get rid of any smell on doctors' hands after an autopsy. No one knew anything about bacteria, germs or viruses at the time.

ðŸŒŸDespite the incredible evidence in favour of Dr Semmelweis' theory - that childbed fever was caused by some "substance" (which today we know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses - was rejected by the medical community at the time. But why?! 

ðŸŒŸPart of the reason is that Semmelweis was not very tactful. He made it look like doctors were giving childbed fever to women (which they in fact were). This is not something people wanted to hear.

ðŸŒŸHowever, he also published his data in the form of long tables without any data visualisations. The long tables made it very hard to see what's actually going on! Also, at the time statistics and statistical arguments were quite uncommon in the field of medicine.

ðŸŒŸLet's strengthen his conclusions using our Data Analysis & Data Visualization techniques:

ðŸŒŸLike:

ðŸ‘‰Use histograms to visualise distributions

ðŸ‘‰Superimpose histograms on top of each other even when the data series have different lengths.

ðŸ‘‰Use a to smooth out kinks in a histogram and visualise a distribution with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)

ðŸ‘‰Improve a KDE by specifying boundaries on the estimates.

ðŸ‘‰Use scipy and test for statistical significance by looking at p-values.

ðŸ‘‰Highlight different parts of a time series chart in Matplotib.

ðŸ‘‰Add and configure a Legend in Matplotlib.

ðŸ‘‰Use NumPy's .where() function to process elements depending on a condition.

ðŸ‘‰Here's the Notebook with all the visualizations done:

ðŸŒŸWith your thorough analysis and compelling visualisations of the handwashing data, we've convinced the hospital board to continue making hand washing obligatory!!
